# What's New

This topic describes the major changes and features of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) Community Edition V3.3.0-CE. 

## New data migration features

* Supports data migration from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. For more information, see [Migrate data within OceanBase Database](5.user-guide/5.data-migration-1/5.migration-solution/9.migrate-data-from-an-oceanbase-database-to-an-oceanbase-database.md).

* Allows you to specify whether to create non-unique indexes after the full migration is completed when you create a data migration project. This improves the performance of full data migration.

## New data synchronization features

* Supports data synchronization from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a Kafka instance. For more information, see [Create a project to synchronize data from an OceanBase database to a Kafka instance](/en-US/5.user-guide/6.data-synchronization-1/3.create-a-synchronization-channel/1.create-a-data-synchronization-link-from-oceanbase-to-the-on-premises.md).
  
* Supports data synchronization from a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database to a RocketMQ instance. 
  
* Supports five general JSON data formats. For more information, see [Data formats](/en-US/5.user-guide/6.data-synchronization-1/2.data-format-description.md).

## Enhanced security

* Supports a user with multiple Admin roles. For more information, see [User management](/en-US/5.user-guide/7.system-management/1.user-management.md).

* You must change the default password when you log on to the OMS console with the Admin account for the first time. For more information, see [Log on to the OMS console](/en-US/5.user-guide/1.management-console/1.data-overview.md).

* Supports secure HTTPS access to the OMS console. For more information, see Deployment Guide.
