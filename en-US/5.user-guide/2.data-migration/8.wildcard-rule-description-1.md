Wildcard rules 
===================================

A wildcard is a short text that represents a group of paths. You can use a wildcard as an elementary regular expression. This topic describes the wildcards you can use to set the rules for migration objects. 
**Notice**



The rules to include or exclude migration objects are case-sensitive. A case inconsistency between a migration rule and the object name causes mismatch of objects.

Asterisk (\*) 
----------------------------------

You can use an asterisk to match a string of characters in any length, or a null character. For example, if you set a \<Schema\>.\* rule in the **Migration Object Rule** field, the **Matching Result** tab in the right-side panel shows all tables and views in the specified schema.

To exclude the objects that are not migrated, you can set the rules in the **Object Exclusion Rule** field, click **Verify and Preview Objects** , and view the excluded objects on the **Matching Result** tab.

Question mark (?) 
--------------------------------------

You can use a question mark to match a single character. To match more than one character, use multiple question marks. For example, if you set a \<Schema\>.t? rule in the **Migration Object Rule** field, the **Matching Result** tab in the right-side panel shows tables and views that conform to the format in the specified schema. 
**Notice**



You cannot use a question mark to match a null character. In other words, the place held by the question mark must have a character.

![Migrate](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8436718461/p397443.png)

To exclude the objects that are not migrated, you can set the rules in the **Object Exclusion Rule** field, click **Verify and Preview Objects** , and view the excluded objects on the **Matching Result** tab.

Square brackets (\[ \]) 
--------------------------------------------

You can use a pair of square brackets to include any characters that must be matched, or use `[start-end]` to match a continuous range. For example, if you set a \<Schema\>.\[\]\* rule in the **Migration Object Rule** field, the **Matching Result** tab in the right-side panel shows tables and views that conform to the format in the specified schema. 

![Match](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8436718461/p397456.png)

To exclude the objects that are not migrated, you can set the rules in the **Object Exclusion Rule** field, click **Verify and Preview Objects** , and view the excluded objects on the **Matching Result** tab.

An exclamation point in square brackets (\[!\]) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use the wildcard to match any non-null characters that are not included in the square brackets, or use `[!start-end]` to indicate a continuous range. For example, if you set a \<Schema\>.\[!\]\* rule in the **Migration Object Rule** field, the **Matching Result** tab in the right-side panel shows tables and views that conform to the format in the specified schema. 

![!](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/8436718461/p397458.png)

To exclude the objects that are not migrated, you can set the rules in the **Object Exclusion Rule** field, click **Verify and Preview Objects** , and view the excluded objects on the **Matching Result** tab.
