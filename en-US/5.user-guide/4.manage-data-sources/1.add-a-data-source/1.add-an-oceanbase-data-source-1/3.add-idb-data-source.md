Add an IDB data source 
===========================================

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. To migrate data from or to an IDB database, you must add the IDB database as the source or destination data source. This topic describes how to add an IDB database as a data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS). 

Background information 
-------------------------------------------

OMS allows you to add an IDB data source and synchronize the data of the IDB data source to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database and DataHub.
An IDB database manages the metadata of logical databases and tables. As OMS accesses a logical table by using its GUID, OMS can obtain the physical topology corresponding to the GUID from the IDB database. All physical tables corresponding to the logical table that is specified by the GUID can be obtained from the physical topology.
Bagualu allows you to obtain the information of a physical OceanBase cluster. OMS pulls the cluster logs during the incremental synchronization stage by using the configurl parameter on ConfigServer. The value of the configurl parameter contains the URLs of all nodes in the cluster.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OMS console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management** .

   

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

   

4. In the **Add Data Source** panel, select **OceanBase** for **Terminal Type** .

   

5. Select **Logical Data Source** , and select **IDB** from the drop-down list.

   

6. Specify the following parameters. 

   

   |         **Parameter**         |                                                                                                   **Description**                                                                                                    |
