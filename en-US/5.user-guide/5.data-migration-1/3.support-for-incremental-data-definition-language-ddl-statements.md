Supported DDL operations for incremental migration and limits 
==================================================================================

This topic describes the supported DDL operations in different types of incremental migration projects and their limits. 

Supported DDL operations for incremental migration from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database and limits 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use DDL operations to migrate incremental data from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. 
**Notice**



If you have created an `index` in the source database, it also exists in the destination database. OMS automatically ignores the `index` without interrupting the migration process. 

OMS supports MySQL 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0.

* Supported DDL operations for incremental migration

  * `create table`

    **Note**

    

    `create table` supports foreign key constraints.
    
  
  * `drop table`

    
  
  * `alter table add partition`

    
  
  * `alter table drop partition`

    
  
  * `alter table add column`

    
  
  * `alter table modify column`

    **Notice**

    

    You can only extend the field length. You cannot modify the field type.
    
  
  * `alter table alter column set default` or `alter table alter column drop default`

    
  
  * `alter table drop column`

    
  
  * `truncate table`

    
  
  * `create index` or `alter table add index`

    
  
  * `drop index` or `alter table drop index`

    
  
  * `rename table` or `alter table rename`

    
  

  

* Limits of DDL operations

  * If the table to be synchronized involves DDL operations that are not supported, the migration may fail and cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * Frequent DDL operations on a table are not supported. After the Store finishes a DDL operation, which can be determined by the checkpoint, it proceeds to the next DDL operation. Otherwise, the Store may exit unexpectedly or cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * Make sure that no DDL operations are performed before you create a Store and during the start of the Store. If log pulling is involved, make sure that no DDL operations are performed between the start time of pulling and the current time. Otherwise, the Store may exit unexpectedly or cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * The tables before and after the `rename table` statement must be those to be synchronized or those do not require synchronization.

    
  
  * If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

    
  
  * In a DDL operation for incremental migration, if the primary key of a table is data of the FLOAT or DOUBLE type, data inconsistency may occur.

    
  
  * If you use gh-ost to synchronize DDL operations for incremental migration from a MySQL database to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database:

    * When you select **Specified object** , do not select the table named \*_ghc.

      
    
    * When you select **Matching rules** , set **Object Exclusion Rules** to {database_name}.\*_ghc.

Supported DDL operations for incremental migration from an Oracle database to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Supported DDL operations for incremental migration

    You can create a partitioned table but cannot execute the `create table as select` statement.
    
  
  * `drop table`

    
  
  * `truncate table`

  * The tables before and after the `rename table` statement must be those to be synchronized or those do not require synchronization.

    
  
  * If you delete an unnamed primary key, the corresponding constraint whose name starts with `SYS_C` in the Oracle database is deleted. If you perform inter-database data migration or synchronization, for example, from an Oracle database to an OceanBase database, the primary keys in the OceanBase database cannot be deleted because they are different from those in the Oracle database.

    
  
  * A table creation DDL operation that involves the `case when index` statement cannot be synchronized.

    
  
  * If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

    | Syntax restriction          | * The Create like syntax is not supported.   * Syntax that contains column type aliases (non-native data types) is not supported.   * Syntax that contains the Select or Subquery statement is not supported.   * An error may be returned if the generated column contains complex functions or incompatible function definitions.   * Syntax that contains the XML data type is not supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
    | Column attribute processing | * Column names, column types, null flag bits, and default values are processed. Other column attribute values are ignored.   * DDL statements do not support attributes of generated columns and do not process the definitions of generated columns.   * Default values with functions should be used with caution. If the functions do not exist in the destination database, the table fails to be created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | Index processing            | * We recommend that you explicitly define indexes, including primary keys, unique keys, and CHECK constraints. CHECK constraints are not preferred. Anonymous indexes automatically generate names, which may cause name conflicts.   * Functions should be used with caution. If the functions do not exist in the destination database, the table fails to be created.   * Foreign keys are not recommended. OMS does not support synchronization of tables with foreign keys. Foreign keys will be discarded during DDL conversion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | Partition                   | * OMS supports synchronization of time-based range partitions but directly translates expressions for non-time-based range partitions. We do not recommend that you use functions in partitions. Functions may cause incompatibility of syntax and further cause failure of the migration project.   * The range of a partition cannot start or end with a representation related to `MINVALUE` or `MAXVALUE`.   * Partitions of the DB2 LUW database must contain the `ending` field with the `exclusive` attribute. Otherwise, an error is returned.   * The DB2 LUW database does not support the `every` syntax extension for partitions to prevent calculation errors .   * In the DB2 LUW database, a partition column is added to the primary key of a table. If the primary key and partitioning key have no intersection, the primary key is changed to a unique index to adapt to the partition rules and constraints of OceanBase Database.   * In the DB2 LUW database, the `create/alter table add partition` statement must contain a partition name. Anonymous partitions are not supported.    |

    
  
  * Alter Table

    * The `alter table add primary` statement in a DB2 LUW database is converted to the `add unique` statement in an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database. OceanBase Database does not support adding a primary key after a table is created. Therefore, you must explicitly specify the primary key when you create a table.

      
    
    * When you execute the `alter table` statement to modify data of the LOB type, you must specify the data length. However, you cannot reduce the length of the LOB-type data by executing the `alter table` statement.

      
    
    * The `unique index` cannot be empty in a DB2 LUW database. Therefore, the column that is specified as the unique key requires NOT NULL constraint. In other words, when you execute the `alter table add unique` statement, you must specify the NOT NULL constraint for the related column.

      
    

    
  
  * Create Index

    You cannot specify Local in the statement to create a regular table in OceanBase Database.
    
  
  * Parse DDL statements

    When you parse DDL statements, you can refer to the official DB2 database documentation to ensure the maximum compatibility. 

    Note the following limits when you parse the source DDL statements in a DB2 LUW database:
    * The DB2 LUW database checks the schema to refresh the cached, parsed source DDL statements. We recommend that you only parse one type of DDL statements at a time and proceed after you confirm the results.

      
    
    * Avoid frequent `create` and `drop` operations on partitioned tables. We recommend that you execute the `create partition table` statement, confirm that the table is synchronized, and then execute the `drop partition table` statement.

      
    
    * The DB2 LUW database can only parse an object whose name consists of letters, underscores (_), and digits, begins with a letter or underscore, and does not contain a DB2 LUW keyword.

      
    
    * If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

      
    

    
  

  




Supported DDL operations for incremental migration between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can use DDL operations to migrate incremental data between MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database. 
**Notice**



If you have created an `index` in the source tenant, it also exists in the destination tenant. OMS automatically ignores the `index` without interrupting the migration process.

* Supported DDL operations for incremental migration

  * `alter table add column`

    
  
  * `alter table modify column`

    **Notice**

    

    You can only extend the field length. You cannot modify the field type.
    
  
  * `alter table alter column set default` or `alter table alter column drop default`

    
  
  * `alter table drop column`

    
  
  * `create table`

    
  
  * `drop table`

    
  
  * `truncate table`

    
  
  * `create index` or `alter table add index`

    
  
  * `drop index` or `alter table drop index`

    
  
  * `rename table` or `alter table rename`

    
  

  

* Limits of DDL operations

  * If the table to be synchronized involves DDL operations that are not supported, the migration may fail and cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * Frequent DDL operations on a table are not supported. After the Store finishes a DDL operation, which can be determined by the checkpoint, it proceeds to the next DDL operation. Otherwise, the Store may exit unexpectedly or cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * Make sure that no DDL operations are performed before you create a Store and during the start of the Store. If log pulling is involved, make sure that no DDL operations are performed between the start time of pulling and the current time. Otherwise, the Store may exit unexpectedly or cause unrecoverable data exceptions.

    
  
  * The tables before and after the `rename table` statement must be those to be synchronized or those do not require synchronization.

    
  
  * If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

* Supported DDL operations for incremental migration

  * `create table`

    You can create a partitioned table but cannot execute the `create table as select` statement. Partitions and subpartitions are supported. You can create partitions and subpartitions by using Hash, Range, or List partitioning.
    
  
  * `drop table`

    
  
  * `truncate table`

    
  
  * `rename table` or `alter table rename`

    
  
  * `alter table add column`

    
  
  * `alter table modify column`

    **Notice**

    

    You can only extend the field length. You cannot modify the field type.
    
  
  * `create index`

    
  
  * `drop index`

    
  
  * Operations for adding and removing comments of tables or columns

  * A table creation DDL operation that involves the `case when index` statement cannot be synchronized.

    
  
  * If you enable DDL operations for incremental data migration, the `drop index` command is executed on all indexes, which may cause index loss in the destination database.

    
  

  




FAQ 
------------------------

Q: What can I do if a data migration project fails because I have performed an unsupported DDL operation in the source database? 

A: Configure the DDL operation in SkipDDL and restart the data migration project. Procedure:

1. Go to the details page of the target project. 

   1. Log on to the OMS console.

      
   
   2. In the left-side navigation pane, click `Data Migration`.

      
   
   3. In the **Migration Projects** list, click the name of the target project to go to its details page.

      
   

   

2. Click **View Component Monitoring** in the upper-right corner.

   

3. On the **View Component Monitoring** page, click **...** for the JDBCWriter component and choose **View Logs** from the short-cut menu.

   

4. Find the error DDL statement in the `error.log` file.

   

5. In the `ddl_msg.log` file, copy the content in `receive ddl:`.

   

6. Update component parameters. 

   1. Return to the **View Component Monitoring** page and click **Update** for the JDBCWriter component.

      
   
   2. On the **Update Configurations** page, move the pointer over the `JDBCWriter.coordinatorFile.skipDdl` parameter. Click the Edit icon, change the value to the copied content, and click the Confirm icon. Multiple DDL statements must be separated with ampersands (\&). You can also change the delimiter.

      
   
   3. Move the pointer over the `extraConfig` parameter. Click the Add icon, add the `JDBCWriter.coordinatorFile.skipDDLSeparator = "$"` parameter, and click the Confirm icon. The default value of the new parameter is \&.

      
   
   4. Click **Update** .

      
   

   

7. Return to the details page of the data migration project, and click **Restore** in the upper-right corner to run the project again.
