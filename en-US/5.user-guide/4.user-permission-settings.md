User privileges 
====================================

Before you migrate data between databases by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS), ensure that you have created a database user for each data source as the migration or synchronization user. The user must have the required privileges on the source and destination data sources. 

Privileges 
-------------------------------

The following table lists the privileges required by users in different databases in different scenarios. Before you create a data source, make sure that you have granted relevant privileges to the specified user.

At the same time, you need to create the same account under the business tenant to be synchronized and grant the `SELECT` privilege to the account.   * If you need full synchronization, you need to create the drc account under the business tenant to be synchronized and grant the `SELECT` privilege to the account.    |

User privileges required when an Oracle database serves as the source or destination 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Incremental migration and reverse incremental migration involve DDL operations. Therefore, the privileges required for migrating data from OceanBase Database to an Oracle database are the same as those required for migrating data from an Oracle database to OceanBase Database. 

This section describes the privileges required for different roles in different versions of Oracle databases. 

### Privileges required for DBA users in Oracle databases earlier than 12c 

If the environment allows you to assign the database administrator (DBA) role to the migration user and the Oracle database version is earlier than 12c, execute the following statement to grant the DBA privileges to the migration user. 

```shell
GRANT DBA TO <user_name>;
```



### Privileges required for non-DBA users in Oracle databases earlier than 12c 

If the environment allows you to grant only the required privileges to the migration user and the Oracle database version is earlier than 12c, perform the following operations:

1. Grant the CONNECT privilege. 

   ```sql
   GRANT CONNECT TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

2. Grant the migration user with the `CREATE SESSION`, `ALTER SESSION`, `SELECT ANY TRANSACTION`, `SELECT ANY TABLE`, and `SELECT ANY DICTIONARY` privileges. 

   ```sql
   GRANT CREATE SESSION, ALTER SESSION, 
   SELECT ANY TRANSACTION, SELECT ANY TABLE, SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

3. Grant the `LOGMINER` privilege to the migration user. 

   ```sql
   GRANT EXECUTE ON SYS.DBMS_LOGMNR TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

4. Grant the `CREATE TABLE` and `UNLIMITED TABLESPACE` privileges to the migration user. 

   ```shell
   GRANT CREATE TABLE, UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

5. If the name of the schema to be migrated is the same as `user_name`, execute the following statement: 

   ```shell
   GRANT CREATE SEQUENCE,CREATE VIEW TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

   If the name of the schema to be migrated is different from `user_name`, execute the following statement: 

   ```javascript
   GRANT CREATE ANY TABLE,CREATE ANY INDEX,DROP ANY TABLE,ALTER ANY TABLE,COMMENT ANY TABLE,
   DROP ANY INDEX,ALTER ANY INDEX,CREATE ANY SEQUENCE,ALTER ANY SEQUENCE,DROP ANY SEQUENCE,
   CREATE ANY VIEW,DROP ANY VIEW,INSERT ANY TABLE,DELETE ANY TABLE,UPDATE ANY TABLE TO <user_name>;
   ```

   

   You can also execute the following statement: 

   ```shell
   GRANT CREATE ANY TABLE,CREATE ANY INDEX,DROP ANY TABLE,ALTER ANY TABLE,COMMENT ANY TABLE,
   DROP ANY INDEX,ALTER ANY INDEX,CREATE ANY SEQUENCE,ALTER ANY SEQUENCE,DROP ANY SEQUENCE,
   CREATE ANY VIEW,DROP ANY VIEW TO <user_name>;
   # Specify the table in the Oracle database to which data is to be migrated. 
   GRANT DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE ON <database name>.<table name> TO <user_name>;
   ```

   




### Privileges required for DBA users in Oracle Database 12c and later versions 

If the environment allows you to assign the DBA role to the migration user and the version of the Oracle database is 12c or later, determine whether to use the pluggable database (PDB) of Oracle Database 12c, 18c, or 19c. 

* Non-PDB

  1. Execute the following statement to grant DBA privileges to the migration user: 

     ```sql
     GRANT DBA TO <user_name>;
     ```

     
  
  2. Execute the following statement to grant the read privilege on the `SYS.USER$` table to the migration user: 

     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT ON SYS.USER$ TO <user_name>;
     ```

     
  

  

* PDB

  If you migrate data from an PDB of Oracle Database 12c, 18c, or 19c to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database, a common user account is required for pulling data from the PDB. 
  1. Execute the following statement to switch to the CDB$ROOT container: 

     ```sql
     ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=CDB$ROOT;
     ```

     

     All common users can connect to the root container named `CDB$ROOT` and any accessible PDB and then perform related operations.
     
  
  2. Execute the following statement to grant DBA privileges to the migration user: 

     ```sql
     GRANT DBA TO C##XXX CONTAINER=ALL;
     ```

     
  
  3. Execute the following statement to grant the read privilege on the `SYS.USER$` table to the migration user: 

     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT ON SYS.USER$ TO C##XXX CONTAINER=ALL;
     ```

     
  

  




### Privileges required for non-DBA users in Oracle Database 12c and later versions 

If the environment allows you to grant only the required privileges to the migration user and the version of the Oracle database is 12c or later, perform the following operations:

* Non-PDB

User privileges required when an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database serves as the destination 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database serves as the destination, the required user privileges vary with the version of OceanBase Database. 

### User privileges required for an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database V2.2.5 or V2.2.3 

You can grant privileges to the migration user by using one of the following two methods:

* Method 1

  * Execute the following statement to grant all privileges to the migration user. This method is simple but high-level privileges are granted. 

    ```unknow
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO <user_name>;
    ```

    
  

  

* Method 2

  1. Grant the `SELECT` privilege on system views under the sys tenant to the migration user. 

     ```unknow
     GRANT SELECT ON SYS.* TO <user_name>;
     ```

     
  
  2. Grant all kinds of privileges on business tables to the migration user. If multiple business databases exist, grant the privileges separately. 

     ```unknow
     GRANT SELECT,UPDATE,DELETE ON <db_name>.* TO <user_name>;
     GRANT CREATE,INDEX,ALTER ON <db_name>.* TO <user_name>;
     ```

     
  

  




### User privileges required for an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database V2.2.7 or later versions 

You can grant privileges to the migration user by using one of the following two methods:

* Method 1

  Execute the following statement to grant DBA privileges to the migration user. This method is simple but high-level privileges are granted. 

  ```unknow
  GRANT DBA TO <user_name>;
  ```

  

* Method 2

  Grant all kinds of privileges on business tables to the migration user. If multiple business databases exist, grant the privileges separately. 

  ```unknow
  GRANT CONNECT TO <user_name>;
  GRANT CREATE SESSION, ALTER SESSION, SELECT ANY TABLE, SELECT ANY DICTIONARY TO <user_name>;
  GRANT CREATE ANY TABLE,INSERT ANY TABLE,UPDATE ANY TABLE,DELETE ANY TABLE TO <user_name>;
  GRANT ALL PRIVIEGES ON *.* TO <user_name>;
  ```

  




### Privileges of the OceanBase Database user for pulling incremental data 

You need to create a user, for example, user `oms_drc`, for the OceanBase cluster under the sys tenant to authenticate OMS when it consumes the Clog logs from the OceanBase cluster. 

The username and password must be the same with `drc_user` and `drc_password` in the OMS deployment configuration file `config.yaml`. 

```unknow
CREATE USER <oms_drc> IDENTIFIED BY <drc_password>;
GRANT SELECT ON OCEANBASE.* TO <oms_drc>;
```
