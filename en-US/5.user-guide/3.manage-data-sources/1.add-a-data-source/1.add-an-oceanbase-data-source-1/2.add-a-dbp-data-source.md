Add a DBP data source 
==========================================

You must configure data sources before you create a data migration project. To migrate data from a DataBase Proxy (DBP) data source, you must add the DBP data source as the source data source. This topic describes how to add a DBP data source in OceanBase Migration Service (OMS). 

Background information 
-------------------------------------------

DBP is a financial-grade distributed database middleware that is independently developed by Ant Financial Technology. It resolves data access bottleneck and database disaster recovery problems under massive requests and provides distributed database services featuring horizontal splitting, smooth scaling, and read/write separation. 

ODP is compatible with the MySQL protocols and syntaxes. It supports features such as database and table sharding, smooth scaling, service upgrading and downgrading, transparent read/write separation, and distributed transactions. It provides lifecycle management of distributed databases. 

After you add a DBP data source in OMS, you can manage all MySQL logical tables in the DBP data source. To synchronize MySQL logical tables to physical tables in a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, you need only to add a DBP data source.

Procedure 
------------------------------

1. Log on to the OMS console.

   

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Data Source Management** .

   

3. On the **Data Sources** page, click **Add Data Source** in the upper-right corner.

   

4. In the **Add Data Source** panel, select **OceanBase** for **Terminal Type** .

   

5. Select **Logical Data Sources** , and select **DBP** from the drop-down list.

   

6. Specify the following parameters. 

   

   |     **Parameter**      |                                                                                                **Description**                                                                                                 |
