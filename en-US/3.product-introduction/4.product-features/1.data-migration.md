Data migration 
===================================

OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) provides the data migration feature to help you easily and quickly migrate data from other data sources to OceanBase in real time. This feature is applicable to scenarios such as data migration from other databases to OceanBase, and OceanBase splitting and scaling. 

The OMS server needs to be connected to both the source instance and the destination instance. You only need to configure the source and destination databases and select the tables that need to be migrated (whitelist) or the tables that do not need to be migrated (blacklist) to start the data migration task. OMS can automatically complete the entire data migration process without requiring manual intervention. 

You can use this feature to migrate the existing data from the source database or data table to the destination database or data table and maintain real-time synchronization of incremental data from the source database to the destination database. 

Migration task 
-----------------------------------

A migration task is a basic unit of the OMS data migration feature. The maximum migration granularity supported by OMS is a database and the minimum migration granularity is a table. The lifecycle of a migration task includes schema migration, full data migration, incremental data migration, and synchronization link management.

Migration type 
-----------------------------------

OMS supports the following migration types: schema migration, full data migration, and incremental data migration.

* Schema migration

  OMS migrates data objects such as tables, indexes, constraints, and comments from the source database to the destination OceanBase database. If the source database is not an OceanBase database, OMS performs format conversion and encapsulation based on the syntax definition and standard of the tenant type of the destination OceanBase database, and then replicates the data to the destination OceanBase database.
  

* Full data migration

  OMS supports migrating the existing data from tables in the source database to corresponding tables in the OceanBase database. OMS supports online data migration. If business data is continuously written into the source database in the full data migration process, before the full data migration is completed, OMS pulls the incremental data from the source database by using the incremental data pull module, parses and encapsulates the incremental data, and stores the encapsulated data.
  

* Incremental data migration

  Incremental data refers to data in the source database that is changed (added, modified, or deleted) after a full data migration task starts. OMS supports migrating incremental data to corresponding tables in the OceanBase. 

  After a full data migration task is completed, OMS starts the incremental data replay module to pull incremental data from the incremental data pull module. The incremental data is synchronized to the destination instance after being filtered, mapped, and converted. 

  After all the incremental data is synchronized to the destination database, OMS maintains a real-time data synchronization link from the source database to the destination database.
  




Data verification 
--------------------------------------

After the full data migration and incremental data migration are completed, OMS automatically initiates a full data verification task to verify the data tables in the source database and the tables in the destination database. 

OMS also provides corresponding APIs for you to initiate custom data verification tasks in the incremental data synchronization process. For inconsistent data detected through verification, OMS provides SQL scripts to correct the data in the destination database based on the data in the source database.
